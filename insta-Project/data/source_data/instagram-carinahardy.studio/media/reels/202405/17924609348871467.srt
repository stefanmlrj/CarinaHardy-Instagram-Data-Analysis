00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,961
I think I never really
appreciated the physicality of

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:07,361
motherhood. The little knees in
your ribs. The like sweet head

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:10,321
like clunking up under your
jaw, knocking your teeth

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,521
together, the ache in your back
after months of night

5
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:17,601
breastfeeding and just the
intensity on your body of

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:21,441
keeping them safe and
conversely also the like

7
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:25,201
physical satisfaction of the
snuggle and just that

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,361
tenderness and scent and
softness and sweetness. Um

9
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:35,241
that's just a constant like
balancing back and forth.
