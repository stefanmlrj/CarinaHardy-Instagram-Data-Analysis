It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a long minute - you look like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thriving and working and musing and arting - I hope spring is feeling good in your homes. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming to NY for my baby sisters graduation this May. Hopefully carrying some new jewelry pieces with me from our unreleased and very art related collection. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always (shamelessly) wanted to shoot with you and I know you pick and choose. I feel like this fine jewelry collection could be a really insanely good fit with you. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in town 12-27th and would love to see you for a coffee or a shoot to say hey! xCarina",
