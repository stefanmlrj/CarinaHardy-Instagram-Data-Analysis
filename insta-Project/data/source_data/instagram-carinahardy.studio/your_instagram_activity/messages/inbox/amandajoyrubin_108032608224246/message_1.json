Some archaeologists have suggested that Minoan Crete was a matriarchy with women in power. Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos, believed that women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s importance was religious, as priestesses of a mother goddess. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nWhether goddesses, priestesses or worshippers, these models reinforce the prominent role of women at Knossos. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nThese particular models are replicas of snake goddesses found at Knossos and can be seen in our current major exhibition Labyrinth: Knossos, Myth & Reality. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\nAshmolean Members enjoy free entry to the exhibition and are invited to an online talk with Dr Andrew Shapland, curator of the exhibition, which will trace the story of the discovery, restoration and replication of these iconic Minoan figures and consider what they represent. \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\n\u00f0\u009f\u0090\u008d Replica figurines of Snake Goddess, 1903 - 1906.

So here they are in pre-moulding and casting stage added to what is called a sprue (the sticks to you see attached). The sprues create the channel in the mould where liquid wax can be injected to create a wax version of this piece. I then cast them in silver & remove the sprues, polish & clean. Each one of these pendents is double sided to form a pair, swipe left to see a video & a picture of Rubens baroque nudes from which the inspiration came from. #boobie #sterlingsilverjewelry #lostwaxcasting #lifeofajeweller #necklaces #pendents #inspiredbyart #rubensart #baroque #jewelleryisart #sculpturaljewellery",

Like a \"lady\".\n(Groan.)\n\nAs women we're supposed to be fiery and protective of our families, our children, our homes, of our relationships and friendships. We're expected to be strong, stand on our own, do it all and be Superwoman.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nEveryone loves the feminine when she is soft and purring, .. but that's only a few facets of the feminine. \n\nWhat about when she ROARS in her truth? \n\nWhen she's on fire? \nWhen she's a fierce storm?\nWhen she is A POWER TO BEHOLD?? \u00e2\u009a\u00a1\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\nThen she should calm down, she should chill, and stop being childish.\nShe should keep her voice down.\n\nWe've been taught that if we speak out and stand up we'll be the crazy/toxic/weird/alien ones.\n\nThis is a LEARNED BEHAVIOR. We've been trained into silence thinking that we won't be lovable. It's BS and we need to peel away\u00c2\u00a0this toxicity and let it go.\n\nIf you have to sacrifice who you are, IT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S NEVER WORTH IT.\n\nSilence is a learned behavior.\n\nEXPRESS WHAT YOU NEED TO WHEN THE SITUATION CALLS YOU TO. \u00f0\u009f\u0097\u00a1\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\nIt just may be the revolution needed to SHAKE the world FREE from the bullsh*t rules that hold it. \u00e2\u009b\u0093\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 C.
