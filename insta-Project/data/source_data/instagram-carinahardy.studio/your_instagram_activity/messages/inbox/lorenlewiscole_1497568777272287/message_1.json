I have to say I see so much underwhelming jewellery around , and I love what you're putting out there. It's important to have a distinct voice. \n\nHow is it going for you? \n\nI'm transitioning to fine and I've given myself a 2 year window . It's not a long term thing really to sell gold plated jewellery ... you have to sell so much. \n\nDo you do wholesale?",
