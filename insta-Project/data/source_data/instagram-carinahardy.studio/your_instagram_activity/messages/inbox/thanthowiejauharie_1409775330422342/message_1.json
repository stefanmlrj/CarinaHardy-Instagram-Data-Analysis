I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Owi an indonesian photographer based in Toulouse, France and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m currently planning to go back to indonesia for a couple of weeks and trying to have some shoot while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m there. \n\nAs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just discovered your brand, and I think I might have a photoshoot reference that could suit your brand well. In that case, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to offer my photography services if you have any need for a photoshoot in the end of May or in early June. \n\nI would like to send you my idea and references and discuss the details with you.\n\nPlease let me know if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested.\n\nThank you\n\nBest regards\nThanthowie Jauharie",
