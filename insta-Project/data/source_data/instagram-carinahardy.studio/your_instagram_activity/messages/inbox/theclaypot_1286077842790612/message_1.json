There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something really special about everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works. \n\nI make jewelry in Bali and I think our fine jewelry collection in18K gold. I really think some of these pieces would be a wonderful fit with Clay Pot. I have a wholesale linesheet to share with you over email. \n\nI am coming up to Rhinebeck and would love to visit you to share some work in person. Do you have availability to meet between the 14th and 24th of May?",
